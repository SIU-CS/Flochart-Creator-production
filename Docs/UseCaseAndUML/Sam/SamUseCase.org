* Use Case: Use conditional statements in flowcharts
** Description
   This use case describes how users can add conditional statements to their flowcharts.
** Actors
*** User
*** Flowchart
** Preconditions
*** A user is viewing a step's edit window
** Basic Flow of Events
   1. The use case begins when a user opens the window to either edit or add a step
   2. Use Case: display edit/new step window with either dummy information or saved information
   3. The form displayed has an option for choosing the step to follow the one being edited
   4. Part of choosing the next step allows for users to specify a conditional
   5. Users will be prompted for the condition being checked and the possible choices
   6. After saving the step, a template will be shown that branches steps as dictated by the conditional
** Alternative Flows
*** Cancel action
    If in steps 1-5 the user decides not to add a conditional, user can simply close the edit window and no edits will be made
*** No conditional supplied
    The conditional will not be applied if no conditional are supplied. Edit window will inform users of the requirement if they try to submit a step without the requisite information.
*** No choices supplied
    The conditional will not be applied if no choices are supplied. Edit window will inform users of the requirement if they try to submit a step without the requisite information.
** Post Conditions
*** Success
    If the conditional is added, it will be displayed on the canvas
*** Failure
    If the conditional is not added, user will be informed with an error message.
** Special Requirements
   1. A maximum of 5 possible choices can be added
** Add Conditional Flowchart

* Use Case: Remove a step from an existing flowchart
** Description
   This use case allows users to remove steps from a flowchart
** Actors
*** User
*** Flowchart
** Preconditions
   User must be in the edit window of a step
** Basic Flow of Events
   1. User opens the edit window for a step
   2. User clicks the "Remove Step" button
   3. User is prompted to either delete the step's children or to apply them to the parent

   5. When user clicks submit, step is deleted and user is take back to the canvas
** Alternative Flows
*** User cancels removal
    If a user decides at any point that they do not want to remove a step, they can cancel the request
*** There are children to the step being removed
    If the step being removed has children, user will have the choice to apply those children to the step's parent, or to delete them as well.
** Post Conditions
*** Success
    When the step is removed, user is taken back to the canvas and shown the new version of the flowchart
*** Failure
    If the step fails to be removes, an error message will be displayed
